# Countdown to Nov 5, 2025

A minimal React + Vite app that shows a live countdown to November 5, 2025 at 12:00 PM (local time).

Getting started (PowerShell):

```powershell
Set-Location -Path 'D:\src\place-holder'
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Notes:
- The target date is interpreted in the local timezone of the browser/host.
- To build a production bundle: `npm run build` and preview with `npm run preview`.
